RxMVC
=====

Scalable, traditional Model-View-Controller with RxJava.

Under Development
-----------------

This project is still under development.
We will write more examples to prove the usability of RxMVC.

Why MVC Again?
--------------

Facebook said

*  "MVC does not scale, Use flux instead."

   But, MVC is scalable.

*  "MVC has bidirectional data flow."

   But, this MVC has unidirectional data flow.

*  "Flux has **singleton** store"

   But, MVC's model doest not have to be a **singleton** object.

MVC is still a great architecture.
Reactive extension will be a great friend of MVC
